	<h1 class="num1"> History of Nueva Ecija </h1>
	<p> Nueva Ecija, officially the Province of Nueva Ecija (Filipino: Lalawigan ng Nueva Ecija locally , also locally ;
	Pangasinan: Luyag na Nueva Ecija; Ilocano: Probinsia ti Nueva Ecija), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located 
	in the Central Luzon region. Its capital is the city of Palayan, while Cabanatuan, its former capital, is the largest local government unit
	(LGU). Nueva Ecija borders, from the south clockwise, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Pangasinan, Nueva Vizcaya and Aurora. The province is nationally 
	known as the Rice Granary of the Philippines, producing the largest rice yield in the country.</p>

	<h1 > Cry of Nueva Ecija</h1>
	<img src="General_Manuel_Tinio.jpg" style="width:20%" align="right"  >
	<p> The "Cry of Nueva Ecija" is the 1896 revolutionary battle led by General Mariano Llanera, manned and assisted by General Manuel Tinio and Pantaleon
	Valmonte of Gapan City, Nueva Ecija and Colonel Alipio Tecson of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija who later on became Brigadaire General. The battle was fought in Cabiao,
	Nueva Ecija. Alipio Tecson would eventually become Governadorcillo of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija. </p>
	
<h1> Tobacco Monopoly </h1>
<p> Maintaining the Philippines as a colony became a challenge for the Spanish Empire. Expenses incurred in running the colony were usually paid for by 
a yearly subsidy (called real situado) sent from the Philippines' sistercolony in Mexico. This financial support from the Spanish royal court was often insufficient, especially with expenditures in the Philippine colony growing each year.</p>
<p>  Novo Ecijanos suffered a lot from the system. Nueva Ecija was more often able to meet production quotas compared to the other districts. Despite this, tobacco 
policy imposed a lower price on tobacco from areas closer to Manila. That meant that 
first-class tobacco leaf grown and harvested from Nueva Ecija was priced lower by one dollar, compared to those from Ilocos, La Union and Cagayan Valley.</p>
<p>The tobacco monopoly did not spur Novo Ecijanos to revolt, unlike the Ilocanos who staged an uprising over injustices in the system. Some tobacco growers in Nueva Ecija resorted to smuggling their own harvests in order to get some profit. But getting caught entailed harsher fines and penalties. Even sympathetic local officials had no choice but to enforce the unjust policies under pain of arrest and hard labor, once laxity on their part resulted in low production.

The flourishing tobacco industry coupled with the rich agricultural lands in central and northeastern Nueva Ecija also attracted migrants from neighboring Pampanga, Pangasinan, Ilocos and Tagalog areas. This made Nueva Ecija a melting pot of cultures and influences, the results of which are still evident in present-day Novo Ecijano culture.

As the tobacco monopoly fuelled further unrest, Spain finally abolished the monopoly on December 3, 1882. It was only then that they could all once again grow rice for food. </p>
<img src="220px-First_prisoners_of_the_Filipino_revolution_in_1896.jpg" style="width:20%" align="right"  >
<h1 > Rebellion against Spain</h1>
<p>One distinct feature of the 1896 revolution against Spain in Nueva Ecija was that it was led by the elite, ruling class instead of the masses. 
Leaders of the revolt in Nueva Ecija were municipal officials and prominent citizens, who refused to collaborate with the Spanish authorities when armed struggle 
broke out. Despite being in the ruling class and enjoying positions in the colonial government, these prominent Novo Ecijanos proved their patriotism and love for
 fellow Filipinos.[19] In fact, one of the founding members of the reform movement La Liga Filipina[20] was lawyer and Novo Ecijano Mamerto Natividad. By the time the
 Katipunan, the revolutionary movement against Spain, was formed, Novo Ecijanos were actively 
yet secretly joining it. Even local officials in Nueva Ecija secretly allied with the illustrados and farmers in forming the underground revolutionary society.</p>
	
	
	<h1 > American Period</h1>
	<img src="220px-Wounded_American_on_stretcher_in_the_Philippines,_1899.jpg" style="width:20%" align="right"  >
	<p> History records how the Philippine–American War began after American troops killed a Filipino soldier who was crossing the San Juan bridge on February 
	4, 1899.[32] One could also say however that hostilities and mistrust really began as early as August 13 the previous year. On that day, the Spanish colonial 
	government in Intramuros surrendered to American forces instead of the Filipino soldiers that surrounded the Walled City. Thus began the United States own effort to 
	have her own colonies, with the Philippines served, as it were, on a silver platter by the dying Spanish Empire thanks to the Treaty of Paris.</p>
	
	<p> When the war between Filipinos and Americans finally began, the fate of the infant Republic of the Philippines again lay in the hands of General 
	Aguinaldo and his most trusted men who included Novo Ecijanos like General Llanera and General Tinio. And, as guerilla warfare became an effective tactic for 
	the Filipinos, Novo Ecijanos were among the most feared guerillas around. Both the Novo Ecijanos and Americans were willing to resort to brutal tactics, torture and 
	even atrocious killings in the course of the war. 
	Two nove ecijanos were deported and exiled in Guam for not taking allegiance to the American government, they were General Mariano Llanera and Col. Alipio Tecson.</p>
	
	
	<h1 >World War II</h1>
	<img src="	220px-AlamoScoutsRaidCabanatuanFeb1945.jpg" style="width:20%" align="right"  >
	<p> During World War II the Imperial Japanese Army entered the province and Nueva Ecija was taken in 1942. On March 29, 1942, under 
	the leadership of Luis Taruc the Hukbalahap (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon-People's Army Against the Japanese) was organized in Sitio Bawit, Barrio San
	Julian in the town of Cabiao. It was perceived to be the military arm of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas
	(Communist Party of the Philippines), that brought about the beginning of the early organized resistance of the Filipino people.</p>
	
	<p>In January to August 1945, combined American and Filipino soldiers liberated Nueva Ecija with the recognized guerrillas continuing to harass the Japanese
	at every opportunity. When Filipino soldiers of the 2nd, 22nd, 23rd, 25th and 26th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 2nd Constabulary 
	Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was re-invading launches to entering liberated the province of Nueva Ecija and helping recognized guerrilla
	resistance fighter units, the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas and the American troops against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Invasion of Nueva Ecija. </p>
	
	<h1 >Flora and Fauna</h1>
	<img src=" Rafflesia_consueloae_open_flower.jpg	" style="width:20%" align="right"  >
	<p>The species of flora and fauna in the province is diverse on its north and east borders, which exhibit a shared ecosystem with the Caraballo mountains
	in the north and the Sierra Madre mountains in the east. The southeast areas are also known for its diverse fauna and flora due to the presence of the Minalungao 
	National Park. The ceratocentron fesselii orchid, which can only be found in the Pantabangan–Carranglan Watershed Forest Reserve in Carranglan, is considered one
	of the most critically endangered orchid species in the entire Southeast Asian region. It is endangered due to illegal gathering from the wild and due to the illegal
	black market trade. The forest reserve is also home to the endemic Rafflesia consueloae, which is the smallest rafflesia in the world and is found nowhere else. 
	Philippine deer, Philippine warty pig, cloud rats, and other indigenous mouse species are also present in the province. In a recent activity, the presence of a 
	Philippine Eagle couple was discovered in the Sierra Madre side of Nueva Ecija. 
	The couple are now protected by the local government units in that area. Snakes, lizards, and various amphibian species are also present, especially in wetter months. </p>

	<h1 > Major industries </h1>
	<img src="220px-NE_rice_paddy.jpg" style="width:20%" class="img1"  >
	<p>Nueva Ecija is one of the top producers of agricultural products in the country. Its principal crops is mainly rice but
	corn and onion are produced in quantity. The province is often referred to as the "Rice Granary of the Philippines".
	Other major crops are mango, calamansi (calamondin orange), banana, garlic, and vegetables. The municipality of Bongabon at the eastern part of 
	the province at the foot of the Sierra Madre mountains and its neighbouring Laur and Rizal are the major producers of onion and garlic.
	Bongabon is called the "onion capital of the country". A sunflower farm is housed inside the Central Luzon State University campus in Science City of Muñoz.</p>
	
	
	<img src="corn.jpg" style="width:20%" class="img1"  >
	<p> Education is very well established as a major industry in the province. The leading educational institutions are the Central Luzon State University
	in Science City of Munoz and Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology, Wesleyan University-Philippines, the only internationally accredited school
	in Central Luzon; College of the Immaculate Conception; La Fortuna College and Araullo University in Cabanatuan City. There are 18 tertiary level institutions
	in Cabanatuan City alone.
	Health services is a notable industry. Hospitals cater to patients from Nueva Ecija and some from neighbouring provinces. There are schools of nursing 
	and midwifery, mostly in Cabanatuan City.</p>

	<img src="onion.jpg" style="width:20%" class="img1"  >
	<p>There are poultry farms in a number of towns, most notably, the Lorenzo poultry farms in San Isidro which is one of the largest in the country.
	Duck raising and egg production is an important livelihood. Fishponds are unevenly distributed throughout the province but the largest concentrations 
	are in San Antonio, Santa Rosa, and Cuyapo.Fabrication of tricycle "sidecars" is widespread in the province, notably in Santa Rosa, where prices are as low as PhP 7,000 which is practically the 
	cheapest in the country.Several areas have mineral deposits. Copper and manganese have been found in General Tinio, Carranglan, and Pantabangan. The upper reaches of Carranglan and Palayan City are said to contain gold.
	In June 2008, it received the title "Milk Capital of the Philippines" because Nueva Ecija gathers more milk from cows and carabaos (water buffaloes) than any other place in the Philippines. The Philippine Carabao Center is in the CLSU compound in Science City of Munoz. </p>
